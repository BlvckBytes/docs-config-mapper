# Add A Translation

In order to introduce a new supported translation, first start by creating a copy of the actively maintained language, namely `en_us.txt`, and rename it to suit what you're about to introduce. All implementations should support a means of live-reloading the configuration, allowing you to preview your progress in-game; make sure that the newly created file is selected as a pre-processor input in the corresponding YAML configuration-file.

If you're up to share your work with others who would like to enable the same translation on their servers, feel free to create a pull-request on the project at hand; translation-files will always reside in the `resources`-folder.
